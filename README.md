  # Quizz

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? I wanted to learn and practive to play with functions. 
I built this because I needed to apply what we've learned in class. I understand the code is not as elegant as it should be and there is also a ton of variables, but I wanted to make sure everything was accessible all the time.
- What problem does it solve?
Well, I just goes about to show that, that I am able to write something from scratch. It doesn't solve a particular problem per say. 
- What did you learn?
Functions, functions functions and Arrays as well.
